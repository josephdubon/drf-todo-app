from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    # Note that the format is apis/v1/.
    # It's a best practice to always version your APIs
    # since they are likely to change in the future but
    # existing users might not be able to update as quickly.
    # path('apis/v1/', include('apis.urls')),
    path('', include('apis.urls')),
